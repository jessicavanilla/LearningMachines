<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project aims to be an AI-powered web application that provides the user with a place to consolidate their clothing and gain inspiration from clothing pieces they already own. Or perhaps they are looking to try new things and change up their aesthetic. This is the place just for you!

We aim to:
* Allow users to upload pictures of each article of clothing into the database
* Provide an AI feature that can pair your already existing pieces together to create an outfit
* Suggest ways to change or spice up your wardrobe for any life occasion, like a job interview or a wedding

This is still a work in progress as a fun side project. 


### Built With

This web application is being built with React using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python for the backend. The database is being hosted on MonogDB.
